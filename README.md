# RIVboard
is a compact, four-button hackpad built around the Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040. Inspired by a tutorial and adapted with custom features, it includes onboard LEDs and a 3D-printed enclosure designed in Fusion 360. Itâ€™s a simple, functional tool for testing, triggering, or building interactive projects.
